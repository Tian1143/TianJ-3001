        <h2>Reflections on this week</h2>
        <p>During the first couple weeks, I found that using html to build my own webpage is pretty interesting. I've found that taking the approach of learning HTML and CSS separately rather than trying to absorb all the things at once is a strategy that not only enhances my understanding but also keeps the learning process from becoming overwhelming. I think I will practice more regularly in my spare time. I am still not getting into Github about how it works and what we can do in Github. I will explore Github more as time goes by. </p>
        <p>For the discussions, I choose interface as my discussion topic. Interfaces are everywhere in our digital world, from the user interfaces of mobile apps to the interfaces of everyday devices and appliances. I think it will be fun to read some articles about that and make a whole powerpoint with my classmates. </p>

        <h2>Life Beyond this Class</h2>
        <p>Beyond this class, I like playing video games and reading novels. I like reading romantic and horror novels, it is kinda a way for me to release pressure. Currently I am playing a PC game called <i>The Long dark</i> which is a RPG game about a lonely man surviving in a wild space. I also work in school as a research assistant researching how video games affect people in multiple ways. Taking this class is because my major focuses on user experience and human computer interface. So the coding information would be an efficient tool for me when I am thinking how to improve user experience in some specific interfaces. </p>
